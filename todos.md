Todos:

- signup should be half complete when you get to it
- data structure of a user needs to include references to who they've been matched up with
- Pairing : take in input from both sides as to whether they want to be connected
- Service: Do a scan on all the users who matched and then reference whether or not they need to be connected.
Connect their linkedin profiles. Make sure to pass in a reference that they were paired so they dont' get repaired
- Styling: Clean it up and make the profiles look good.
