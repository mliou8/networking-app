##List of things still need to be done


Todos:

- signup should be half complete when you get to it
- data structure of a user needs to include references to who they've been matched up with
- Pairing : take in input from both sides as to whether they want to be connected
- Service: Do a scan on all the users who matched and then reference whether or not they need to be connected.
Connect their linkedin profiles. Make sure to pass in a reference that they were paired so they dont' get repaired
- Styling: Clean it up and make the profiles look good.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

<!-- -- Photo needs to be able to upload something for them (auto saves or updates) -->
<!-- -- Add a a submit button that sends all the updated info to Firebase but not the image it's already done. -->
<!-- -- tags needs to be added, and then you hit save -->

--- Add a field for linkedin profile (Must be public url)
-- Display that... with the linkedin integration icon.

-- MATCH Page/ Here is where you view the people that you've matched with.
-- Note: I tracked down the thought about the Yes or NO. I was influenced by Tinder and dating apps.
 Realistically I didn't need to ask you at all if you wanted to be matched, I did that work for you upfront.
 Remove the yes/no functionality and the update logic.
-- Bio... 1 line
-- After profile completion is filled out and saved profile, redirect to match page. 

<!-- -- Bio... 1 line -->
<!-- -- After profile completion is filled out and saved profile, redirect to match page.  -->

-- Add in functionality to change saved photo, or modify your profile info. 

-- Tags should be capped at 3 max. Including the hardcoded one that you were added to.
