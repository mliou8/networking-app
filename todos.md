##List of things still need to be done


Todos:

- signup should be half complete when you get to it
- data structure of a user needs to include references to who they've been matched up with
- Pairing : take in input from both sides as to whether they want to be connected
- Service: Do a scan on all the users who matched and then reference whether or not they need to be connected.
Connect their linkedin profiles. Make sure to pass in a reference that they were paired so they dont' get repaired
- Styling: Clean it up and make the profiles look good.

<!-- Fetch a user who is not yourself, display them on the screen next to yourself, and then log an action from you to them, then log that you guys have "matched".

Update a users 'match potentials' based during user creation one time/ -->

<!-- Dispatch an action that updates that array with 3 fields - active,  -->

<!-- Check for whether or not the other person also liked u. If they did, then display a match. if they didn't, then say. Ok check back in x amount of time. -->

Set up the user creation data to account for 'the tags'. It's in the profile data, and you can add or remove them properly.
